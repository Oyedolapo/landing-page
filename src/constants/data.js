    },

    {
        question: "How do you guarantee security and impersonation?",
        answer: "On registration of artisan, the system generates a unique code that links individual artisan to their Service provider.

    {
        question: "How does the transaction work?",
        answer: "On arrival at the job site, the customer is charged a pre-set fee. The artisan then goes on to assess the issue. If it doesnâ€™t require materials, the artisan fixes the issue and the customer is charged a fee. If it requires materials, the artisan quote for the job via the app. The quote goes to the Service Manager at Call2Fix and the customer. Once the customer accepts the quote, the sum is deducted from his/her account."
    },

    {
        question: "How do you guarantee customers?",
        answer: "There is a clear gap in the market for this service. Call2Fix is therefore committing huge resources to ensure that awareness is created for this product to fill the gap. This marketing communication, being carried out by one of Nigeriaâ€™s leading Marketing Communications companies, is aimed at bringing more customers for our service providers. We take care of the marketing spend, you get the job. Itâ€™s that straightforward."
