        answer: "Yes. So long as you meet all pre-qualification criteria. However, Call2Fix will encourage you to register your company within your first six months on the platform."
    },

    },

    {
        question: "How do you guarantee security and impersonation?",
        answer: "On registration of artisan, the system generates a unique code that links individual artisan to their Service provider. This code, in addition to the artisan’s image is what the customer receives when they are assigned an artisan. The customer has a duty to check this code to ensure it matches with the artisan’s when the artisan arrives at the job site."

    },

    {
        question: "How does the transaction work?",
        answer: "On arrival at the job site, the customer is charged a pre-set fee. The artisan then goes on to assess the issue. If it doesn’t require materials, the artisan fixes the issue and the customer is charged a fee. If it requires materials, the artisan quote for the job via the app. The quote goes to the Service Manager at Call2Fix and the customer. Once the customer accepts the quote, the sum is deducted from his/her account."
    },

    {
        question: "How do you guarantee customers?",
        answer: "There is a clear gap in the market for this service. Call2Fix is therefore committing huge resources to ensure that awareness is created for this product to fill the gap. This marketing communication, being carried out by one of Nigeria’s leading Marketing Communications companies, is aimed at bringing more customers for our service providers. We take care of the marketing spend, you get the job. It’s that straightforward."
